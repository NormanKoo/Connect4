# Connect4
Connect4 is a two-player connection board game in which the players take turns to drop colored disc (or in this case, number representing the disc) from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The discs fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

This version allows players to play against computer at an easy or medium difficulty level. Players are able to make configuration of the board size and the number of discs to win. PopOut function is also enabled.  During each turn, a player can either add another disc from the top or, if one has any discs of his or her own color on the bottom row, remove (or "pop out") a disc of one's own color from the bottom. Popping a disc out from the bottom drops every disc above it down one space, changing their relationship with the rest of the board and changing the possibilities for a connection.
